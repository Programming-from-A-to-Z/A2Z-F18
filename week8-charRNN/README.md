## Examples of data that do not fit ANNs/CNNs
* Text (sequence of characters, words)
* Music (sequences of notes, rhythm)
* Drawings (sequences of "vector" paths)
* hidden state: values of hidden vector at a given time

## RNN Parameters
* `maxlen` - length of a "sentence" for inputting into RNN.
* temperature (aka "diversity"): A number in the range of 0-1 (cannot be 0). The temperature divides probabilities before sampling the next character. Lower temperature will result in more "expected" outcomes (high probabilities are even higher). A higher temperature increases the "diversity" of outcomes, but may produce less "correct-sounding" results.

## RNN architectures
* one to one (ANN)
* one to many (captioning)
* many to one (sentiment analysis)
* many to many (text, music generation, language translation)
